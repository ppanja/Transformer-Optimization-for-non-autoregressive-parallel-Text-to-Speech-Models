DUMMY/arctic_a0001.wav|Author of the danger trail, Philip Steels, etc.
DUMMY/arctic_a0002.wav|Not at this particular case, Tom, apologized Whittemore.
DUMMY/arctic_a0003.wav|For the twentieth time that evening the two men shook hands.
DUMMY/arctic_a0004.wav|Lord, but I'm glad to see you again, Phil.
DUMMY/arctic_a0005.wav|Will we ever forget it.
DUMMY/arctic_a0006.wav|God bless 'em, I hope I'll go on seeing them forever.
DUMMY/arctic_a0007.wav|And you always want to see it in the superlative degree.
DUMMY/arctic_a0008.wav|Gad, your letter came just in time.
DUMMY/arctic_a0009.wav|He turned sharply, and faced Gregson across the table.
DUMMY/arctic_a0010.wav|I'm playing a single hand in what looks like a losing game.
DUMMY/arctic_a0011.wav|If I ever needed a fighter in my life I need one now.
DUMMY/arctic_a0012.wav|Gregson shoved back his chair and rose to his feet.
DUMMY/arctic_a0013.wav|He was a head shorter than his companion, of almost delicate physique.
DUMMY/arctic_a0014.wav|Now you're coming down to business, Phil, he exclaimed.
DUMMY/arctic_a0015.wav|It's the aurora borealis.
DUMMY/arctic_a0016.wav|There's Fort Churchill, a rifle-shot beyond the ridge, asleep.
DUMMY/arctic_a0017.wav|From that moment his friendship for Belize turns to hatred and jealousy.
DUMMY/arctic_a0018.wav|There was a change now.
DUMMY/arctic_a0019.wav|I followed the line of the proposed railroad, looking for chances.
DUMMY/arctic_a0020.wav|Clubs and balls and cities grew to be only memories.
DUMMY/arctic_a0021.wav|It fairly clubbed me into recognizing it.
DUMMY/arctic_a0022.wav|Hardly were our plans made public before we were met by powerful opposition.
DUMMY/arctic_a0023.wav|A combination of Canadian capital quickly organized and petitioned for the same privileges.
DUMMY/arctic_a0024.wav|It was my reports from the north which chiefly induced people to buy.
DUMMY/arctic_a0025.wav|I was about to do this when cooler judgment prevailed.
DUMMY/arctic_a0026.wav|It occurred to me that there would have to be an accounting.
DUMMY/arctic_a0027.wav|To my surprise he began to show actual enthusiasm in my favor.
DUMMY/arctic_a0028.wav|Robbery, bribery, fraud,
DUMMY/arctic_a0029.wav|Their forces were already moving into the north country.
DUMMY/arctic_a0030.wav|I had faith in them.
DUMMY/arctic_a0031.wav|They were three hundred yards apart.
DUMMY/arctic_a0032.wav|Since then some mysterious force has been fighting us at every step.
DUMMY/arctic_a0033.wav|He unfolded a long typewritten letter, and handed it to Gregson.
DUMMY/arctic_a0034.wav|Men of Selden's stamp don't stop at women and children.
DUMMY/arctic_a0035.wav|He stopped, and Philip nodded at the horrified question in his eyes.
DUMMY/arctic_a0036.wav|She turned in at the hotel.
DUMMY/arctic_a0037.wav|I was the only one who remained sitting.
DUMMY/arctic_a0038.wav|We'll have to watch our chances.
DUMMY/arctic_a0039.wav|The ship should be in within a week or ten days.
DUMMY/arctic_a0040.wav|I suppose you wonder why she is coming up here.
DUMMY/arctic_a0041.wav|Meanwhile I'll go out to breathe a spell.
DUMMY/arctic_a0042.wav|How could he explain his possession of the sketch.
DUMMY/arctic_a0043.wav|It seemed nearer to him since he had seen and talked with Gregson.
DUMMY/arctic_a0044.wav|Her own betrayal of herself was like tonic to Philip.
DUMMY/arctic_a0045.wav|He moved away as quietly as he had come.
DUMMY/arctic_a0046.wav|The girl faced him, her eyes shining with sudden fear.
DUMMY/arctic_a0047.wav|Close beside him gleamed the white fangs of the wolf-dog.
DUMMY/arctic_a0048.wav|He looked at the handkerchief more, closely.
DUMMY/arctic_a0049.wav|Gregson was asleep when he re-entered the cabin.
DUMMY/arctic_a0050.wav|In spite of their absurdity the words affected Philip curiously.
DUMMY/arctic_a0051.wav|The lace was of a delicate ivory color, faintly tinted with yellow.
DUMMY/arctic_a0052.wav|It was a curious coincidence.
DUMMY/arctic_a0053.wav|Suddenly his fingers closed tightly over the handkerchief.
DUMMY/arctic_a0054.wav|There was nothing on the rock.
DUMMY/arctic_a0055.wav|Philip stood undecided, his ears strained to catch the slightest sound.
DUMMY/arctic_a0056.wav|Pearce's little eyes were fixed on him shrewdly.
DUMMY/arctic_a0057.wav|I have no idea, replied Philip.
DUMMY/arctic_a0058.wav|I came for information more out of curiosity than anything else.
DUMMY/arctic_a0059.wav|His immaculate appearance was gone.
DUMMY/arctic_a0060.wav|Anyway, no one saw her like that.
DUMMY/arctic_a0061.wav|Philip snatched at the letter which Gregson held out to him.
DUMMY/arctic_a0062.wav|The men stared into each other's face.
DUMMY/arctic_a0063.wav|Yes, it was a man who asked, a stranger.
DUMMY/arctic_a0064.wav|The fourth and fifth days passed without any developments.
DUMMY/arctic_a0065.wav|They closed now until his fingers were like cords of steel.
DUMMY/arctic_a0066.wav|He saw Jeanne falter for a moment.
DUMMY/arctic_a0067.wav|Surely I will excuse you, she cried.
DUMMY/arctic_a0068.wav|In a flash Philip followed its direction.
DUMMY/arctic_a0069.wav|It was his intention to return to Eileen and her father.
DUMMY/arctic_a0070.wav|He would first hunt up Gregson and begin his work there.
DUMMY/arctic_a0071.wav|What was the object of your little sensation.
DUMMY/arctic_a0072.wav|But who was Eileen's double.
DUMMY/arctic_a0073.wav|The promoter's eyes were heavy, with little puffy bags under them.
DUMMY/arctic_a0074.wav|And now, down there, Eileen was waiting for him.
DUMMY/arctic_a0075.wav|There has been a change, she interrupted him.
DUMMY/arctic_a0076.wav|The gray eyes faltered; the flush deepened.
DUMMY/arctic_a0077.wav|It is the fire, partly, she said.
DUMMY/arctic_a0078.wav|Then, and at supper, he tried to fathom her.
DUMMY/arctic_a0079.wav|It was a large canoe.
DUMMY/arctic_a0080.wav|What if Jeanne failed him.
DUMMY/arctic_a0081.wav|What if she did not come to the rock.
DUMMY/arctic_a0082.wav|His face was streaming with blood.
DUMMY/arctic_a0083.wav|A shadow was creeping over Pierre's eyes.
DUMMY/arctic_a0084.wav|Scarcely had he uttered the name when Pierre's closing eyes shot open.
DUMMY/arctic_a0085.wav|A trickle of fresh blood ran over his face.
DUMMY/arctic_a0086.wav|Death had come with terrible suddenness.
DUMMY/arctic_a0087.wav|Philip bent lower, and stared into the face of the dead man.
DUMMY/arctic_a0088.wav|He made sure that the magazine was loaded, and resumed his paddling.
DUMMY/arctic_a0089.wav|The nightglow was treacherous to shoot by.
DUMMY/arctic_a0090.wav|The singing voice approached rapidly.
DUMMY/arctic_a0091.wav|His blood grew hot with rage at the thought.
DUMMY/arctic_a0092.wav|He went down in midstream, searching the shadows of both shores.
DUMMY/arctic_a0093.wav|For a full minute he crouched and listened.
DUMMY/arctic_a0094.wav|He had barely entered this when he saw the glow of a fire.
DUMMY/arctic_a0095.wav|A big canvas tent was the first thing to come within his vision.
DUMMY/arctic_a0096.wav|Perhaps she had already met her fate a little deeper in the forest.
DUMMY/arctic_a0097.wav|Then you can arrange yourself comfortably among these robes in the bow.
DUMMY/arctic_a0098.wav|Shall I carry you.
DUMMY/arctic_a0099.wav|A maddening joy pounded in his brain.
DUMMY/arctic_a0100.wav|You must sleep, he urged.
DUMMY/arctic_a0101.wav|You, you would not keep the truth from me.
DUMMY/arctic_a0102.wav|He will follow us soon.
DUMMY/arctic_a0103.wav|But there came no promise from the bow of the canoe.
DUMMY/arctic_a0104.wav|She was sleeping under his protection as sweetly as a child.
DUMMY/arctic_a0105.wav|Only, it is so wonderful, so almost impossible to believe.
DUMMY/arctic_a0106.wav|The emotion which she had suppressed burst forth now in a choking sob.
DUMMY/arctic_a0107.wav|If you only could know how I thank you.
DUMMY/arctic_a0108.wav|He waded into the edge of the water and began scrubbing himself.
DUMMY/arctic_a0109.wav|Do you know that you are shaking my confidence in you.
DUMMY/arctic_a0110.wav|Much, replied Jeanne, as tersely.
DUMMY/arctic_a0111.wav|Instead, he joined her; and they ate like two hungry children.
DUMMY/arctic_a0112.wav|He was wounded in the arm.
DUMMY/arctic_a0113.wav|I suppose you picked that lingo up among the Indians.
DUMMY/arctic_a0114.wav|Her words sent a strange chill through Philip.
DUMMY/arctic_a0115.wav|He had no excuse for the feelings which were aroused in him.
DUMMY/arctic_a0116.wav|Was it the rendezvous of those who were striving to work his ruin.
DUMMY/arctic_a0117.wav|She added, with genuine sympathy in her face and voice.
DUMMY/arctic_a0118.wav|Pierre obeys me when we are together.
DUMMY/arctic_a0119.wav|Jeanne was turning the bow shoreward.
DUMMY/arctic_a0120.wav|My right foot feels like that of a Chinese debutante.
DUMMY/arctic_a0121.wav|They ate dinner at the fifth, and rested for two hours.
DUMMY/arctic_a0122.wav|Two years ago I gave up civilization for this.
DUMMY/arctic_a0123.wav|She had died from cold and starvation.
DUMMY/arctic_a0124.wav|It was Jeanne singing softly over beyond the rocks.
DUMMY/arctic_a0125.wav|He was determined now to maintain a more certain hold upon himself.
DUMMY/arctic_a0126.wav|Each day she became a more vital part of him.
DUMMY/arctic_a0127.wav|It was a temptation, but he resisted it.
DUMMY/arctic_a0128.wav|This one hope was destroyed as quickly as it was born.
DUMMY/arctic_a0129.wav|Her face was against his breast.
DUMMY/arctic_a0130.wav|She was his now, forever.
DUMMY/arctic_a0131.wav|Providence had delivered him through the maelstrom.
DUMMY/arctic_a0132.wav|A cry of joy burst from Philip's lips.
DUMMY/arctic_a0133.wav|Philip began to feel that he had foolishly overestimated his strength.
DUMMY/arctic_a0134.wav|He obeyed the pressure of her hand.
DUMMY/arctic_a0135.wav|I am going to surprise father, and you will go with Pierre.
DUMMY/arctic_a0136.wav|About him, everywhere, were the evidences of luxury and of age.
DUMMY/arctic_a0137.wav|Then he stepped back with a low cry of pleasure.
DUMMY/arctic_a0138.wav|In the picture he saw each moment a greater resemblance to Jeanne.
DUMMY/arctic_a0139.wav|He told himself that as he washed himself and groomed his disheveled clothes.
DUMMY/arctic_a0140.wav|Accept a father's blessing, and with it, this.
DUMMY/arctic_a0141.wav|It seems like a strange pointing of the hand of God.
DUMMY/arctic_a0142.wav|Such things had occurred before, he told Philip.
DUMMY/arctic_a0143.wav|Ah, I had forgotten, he exclaimed.
DUMMY/arctic_a0144.wav|But there was something even more startling than this resemblance.
DUMMY/arctic_a0145.wav|I have to be careful of them, as they tear very easily.
DUMMY/arctic_a0146.wav|Of course, that is uninteresting, she continued.
DUMMY/arctic_a0147.wav|A moment before he was intoxicated by a joy that was almost madness.
DUMMY/arctic_a0148.wav|Now these things had been struck dead within him.
DUMMY/arctic_a0149.wav|For an instant he saw Pierre drawn like a silhouette against the sky.
DUMMY/arctic_a0150.wav|Goodbye, Pierre, he shouted.
DUMMY/arctic_a0151.wav|And MacDougall was beyond the trail, with three weeks to spare.
DUMMY/arctic_a0152.wav|Philip thrust himself against it and entered.
DUMMY/arctic_a0153.wav|MacDougall tapped his forehead suspiciously with a stubby forefinger.
DUMMY/arctic_a0154.wav|He was smooth-shaven, and his hair and eyes were black.
DUMMY/arctic_a0155.wav|Won't you draw up, gentlemen.
DUMMY/arctic_a0156.wav|A strange fire burned in his eyes when Thorpe turned.
DUMMY/arctic_a0157.wav|He had worshiped her, as Dante might have worshiped Beatrice.
DUMMY/arctic_a0158.wav|Does that look good.
DUMMY/arctic_a0159.wav|They look as though he had been drumming a piano all his life.
DUMMY/arctic_a0160.wav|You want to go over and see his gang throw dirt.
DUMMY/arctic_a0161.wav|Take away their foreman and they wouldn't be worth their grub.
DUMMY/arctic_a0162.wav|That's the sub-foreman, explained Thorpe.
DUMMY/arctic_a0163.wav|Philip made no effort to follow.
DUMMY/arctic_a0164.wav|He came first a year ago, and revealed himself to Jeanne.
DUMMY/arctic_a0165.wav|They are to attack your camp tomorrow night.
DUMMY/arctic_a0166.wav|Two days ago Jeanne learned where her father's men were hiding.
DUMMY/arctic_a0167.wav|I was near the cabin, and saw you.
DUMMY/arctic_a0168.wav|Low bush whipped him in the face and left no sting.
DUMMY/arctic_a0169.wav|Suddenly Jeanne stopped for an instant.
DUMMY/arctic_a0170.wav|There was none of the joy of meeting in his face.
DUMMY/arctic_a0171.wav|And when you come back in a few days, bring Eileen.
DUMMY/arctic_a0172.wav|Gregson had left the outer door slightly ajar.
DUMMY/arctic_a0173.wav|The date was nearly eighteen years old.
DUMMY/arctic_a0174.wav|They were the presage of storm.
DUMMY/arctic_a0175.wav|Down there the earth was already swelling with life.
DUMMY/arctic_a0176.wav|For the first time in his life he was yearning for a scrap.
DUMMY/arctic_a0177.wav|She had been thoroughly and efficiently mauled.
DUMMY/arctic_a0178.wav|Every bone in her aged body seemed broken or dislocated.
DUMMY/arctic_a0179.wav|Tomorrow I'm going after that bear, he said.
DUMMY/arctic_a0180.wav|If not, let's say our prayers and go to bed.
DUMMY/arctic_a0181.wav|So cheer up, and give us your paw.
DUMMY/arctic_a0182.wav|This time he did not yap for mercy.
DUMMY/arctic_a0183.wav|And the air was growing chilly.
DUMMY/arctic_a0184.wav|Don't you see, I'm chewing this thing in two.
DUMMY/arctic_a0185.wav|The questions may have come vaguely in his mind.
DUMMY/arctic_a0186.wav|Like a flash he launched himself into the feathered mass of the owl.
DUMMY/arctic_a0187.wav|Ahead of them they saw a glimmer of sunshine.
DUMMY/arctic_a0188.wav|Two gigantic owls were tearing at the carcass.
DUMMY/arctic_a0189.wav|The big-eyed, clucking moose-birds were most annoying.
DUMMY/arctic_a0190.wav|Next to them the Canada jays were most persistent.
DUMMY/arctic_a0191.wav|For a time the exciting thrill of his adventure was gone.
DUMMY/arctic_a0192.wav|He did not rush in.
DUMMY/arctic_a0193.wav|It was edged with ice.
DUMMY/arctic_a0194.wav|He drank of the water cautiously.
DUMMY/arctic_a0195.wav|But a strange thing happened.
DUMMY/arctic_a0196.wav|He began to follow the footprints of the dog.
DUMMY/arctic_a0197.wav|Such a dog the wise driver kills, or turns loose.
DUMMY/arctic_a0198.wav|Sometimes her dreams were filled with visions.
DUMMY/arctic_a0199.wav|Thus had the raw wilderness prepared him for this day.
DUMMY/arctic_a0200.wav|He leapt again, and the club caught him once more.
DUMMY/arctic_a0201.wav|He cried, and swung the club wildly.
DUMMY/arctic_a0202.wav|She turned, fearing that Jacques might see what was in her face.
DUMMY/arctic_a0203.wav|They were following the shore of a lake.
DUMMY/arctic_a0204.wav|The wolf-dog thrust his gaunt muzzle toward him.
DUMMY/arctic_a0205.wav|From now on we're pals.
DUMMY/arctic_a0206.wav|He says he bought him of Jacques Le Beau.
DUMMY/arctic_a0207.wav|How much was it.
DUMMY/arctic_a0208.wav|Youth had come back to her, freed from the yoke of oppression.
DUMMY/arctic_a0209.wav|It was not a large lake, and almost round.
DUMMY/arctic_a0210.wav|Its diameter was not more than two hundred yards.
DUMMY/arctic_a0211.wav|It drowned all sound that brute agony and death may have made.
DUMMY/arctic_a0212.wav|Fresh cases, still able to walk, they clustered about the spokesman.
DUMMY/arctic_a0213.wav|Between him and the beach was the cane-grass fence of the compound.
DUMMY/arctic_a0214.wav|Besides, he was paid one case of tobacco per head.
DUMMY/arctic_a0215.wav|They die out of spite.
DUMMY/arctic_a0216.wav|The other felt a sudden wave of irritation rush through him.
DUMMY/arctic_a0217.wav|Oppressive as the heat had been, it was now even more oppressive.
DUMMY/arctic_a0218.wav|The ringing of the big bell aroused him.
DUMMY/arctic_a0219.wav|At first he puzzled over something untoward he was sure had happened.
DUMMY/arctic_a0220.wav|A dead man is of no use on a plantation.
DUMMY/arctic_a0221.wav|I don't know why you're here at all.
DUMMY/arctic_a0222.wav|What part of the United States is your home.
DUMMY/arctic_a0223.wav|My, I'm almost homesick for it already.
DUMMY/arctic_a0224.wav|She nodded, and her eyes grew soft and moist.
DUMMY/arctic_a0225.wav|I was brought up the way most girls in Hawaii are brought up.
DUMMY/arctic_a0226.wav|That came before my A B C's.
DUMMY/arctic_a0227.wav|It was the same way with our revolvers and rifles.
DUMMY/arctic_a0228.wav|But it contributed to the smash.
DUMMY/arctic_a0229.wav|The last one I knew was an overseer.
DUMMY/arctic_a0230.wav|Do you know any good land around here.
DUMMY/arctic_a0231.wav|The Resident Commissioner is away in Australia.
DUMMY/arctic_a0232.wav|I cannot follow you, she said.
DUMMY/arctic_a0233.wav|I never allow what can't be changed to annoy me.
DUMMY/arctic_a0234.wav|Why, the average review is more nauseating than cod liver oil.
DUMMY/arctic_a0235.wav|His voice was passionately rebellious.
DUMMY/arctic_a0236.wav|Don't you see I hate you.
DUMMY/arctic_a0237.wav|So Hughie and I did the managing ourselves.
DUMMY/arctic_a0238.wav|It happened to him at the Gallina Society in Oakland one afternoon.
DUMMY/arctic_a0239.wav|He cried in such genuine dismay that she broke into hearty laughter.
DUMMY/arctic_a0240.wav|Wash your hands of me.
DUMMY/arctic_a0241.wav|I think it's much nicer to quarrel.
DUMMY/arctic_a0242.wav|I saw it when she rolled.
DUMMY/arctic_a0243.wav|I only read the quotations.
DUMMY/arctic_a0244.wav|He was the soul of devotion to his employers.
DUMMY/arctic_a0245.wav|Out of his eighteen hundred, he laid aside sixteen hundred each year.
DUMMY/arctic_a0246.wav|You have heard always how he was the lover of the Princess Naomi.
DUMMY/arctic_a0247.wav|They ought to pass here some time today.
DUMMY/arctic_a0248.wav|I had been sad too long already.
DUMMY/arctic_a0249.wav|All eyes, however, were staring at him in certitude of expectancy.
DUMMY/arctic_a0250.wav|He had observed the business life of Hawaii and developed a vaulting ambition.
DUMMY/arctic_a0251.wav|I may manage to freight a cargo back as well.
DUMMY/arctic_a0252.wav|O'Brien had been a clean living young man with ideals.
DUMMY/arctic_a0253.wav|He it was that lived to found the family of the Patino.
DUMMY/arctic_a0254.wav|Straight out they swam, their heads growing smaller and smaller.
DUMMY/arctic_a0255.wav|You won't die of malnutrition, be sure of that.
DUMMY/arctic_a0256.wav|See the length of the body and that elongated neck.
DUMMY/arctic_a0257.wav|They are coming ashore, whoever they are.
DUMMY/arctic_a0258.wav|Soaked in seawater they offset the heat rays.
DUMMY/arctic_a0259.wav|Think of investing in such an adventure.
DUMMY/arctic_a0260.wav|Nobody knew his history, they of the Junta least of all.
DUMMY/arctic_a0261.wav|I have been doubly baptized.
DUMMY/arctic_a0262.wav|They wouldn't be sweeping a big vessel like the Martha.
DUMMY/arctic_a0263.wav|Joan looked triumphantly at Sheldon, who bowed.
DUMMY/arctic_a0264.wav|And I hope you've got plenty of chain out, Captain Young.
DUMMY/arctic_a0265.wav|The discovery seemed to have been made on the spur of the moment.
DUMMY/arctic_a0266.wav|They handled two men already, both grub-thieves.
DUMMY/arctic_a0267.wav|Eli Harding asked, as Shunk started to follow.
DUMMY/arctic_a0268.wav|Now go ahead and tell me in a straightforward way what has happened.
DUMMY/arctic_a0269.wav|That's where they cut off the Scottish Chiefs and killed all hands.
DUMMY/arctic_a0270.wav|And after the bath a shave would not be bad.
DUMMY/arctic_a0271.wav|Now please give a plain statement of what occurred.
DUMMY/arctic_a0272.wav|You can take a vacation on pay.
DUMMY/arctic_a0273.wav|They are big trees and require plenty of room.
DUMMY/arctic_a0274.wav|And Raoul listened again to the tale of the house.
DUMMY/arctic_a0275.wav|There are no kiddies and half grown youths among them.
DUMMY/arctic_a0276.wav|Oolong Atoll was one hundred and forty miles in circumference.
DUMMY/arctic_a0277.wav|McCoy found a stifling, poisonous atmosphere in the pent cabin.
DUMMY/arctic_a0278.wav|It would give me nervous prostration.
DUMMY/arctic_a0279.wav|She said with chattering teeth.
DUMMY/arctic_a0280.wav|I'll be out of my head in fifteen minutes.
DUMMY/arctic_a0281.wav|I do not blame you for anything; remember that.
DUMMY/arctic_a0282.wav|If you mean to insinuate -- Brentwood began hotly.
DUMMY/arctic_a0283.wav|The woman in you is only incidental, accidental, and irrelevant.
DUMMY/arctic_a0284.wav|There was no forecasting this strange girl's processes.
DUMMY/arctic_a0285.wav|But what they want with your toothbrush is more than I can imagine.
DUMMY/arctic_a0286.wav|Give them their choice between a fine or an official whipping.
DUMMY/arctic_a0287.wav|Keep an eye on him.
DUMMY/arctic_a0288.wav|Those are my oysters, he said at last.
DUMMY/arctic_a0289.wav|They are not regular oyster pirates, Nicholas continued.
DUMMY/arctic_a0290.wav|One by one the boys were captured.
DUMMY/arctic_a0291.wav|The weeks had gone by, and no overt acts had been attempted.
DUMMY/arctic_a0292.wav|Here, in the midmorning, the first casualty occurred.
DUMMY/arctic_a0293.wav|They were deep in the primeval forest.
DUMMY/arctic_a0294.wav|He had been foiled in his attempt to escape.
DUMMY/arctic_a0295.wav|And twenty men could hold it with spears and arrows.
DUMMY/arctic_a0296.wav|Bassett was a fastidious man.
DUMMY/arctic_a0297.wav|There's a big English general right now whose name is Roberts.
DUMMY/arctic_a0298.wav|This tacit promise of continued acquaintance gave Saxon a little joy-thrill.
DUMMY/arctic_a0299.wav|I tell you I am disgusted with this adventure tomfoolery and rot.
DUMMY/arctic_a0300.wav|From my earliest recollection my sleep was a period of terror.
DUMMY/arctic_a0301.wav|But all my dreams violated this law.
DUMMY/arctic_a0302.wav|It is very plausible to such people, a most convincing hypothesis.
DUMMY/arctic_a0303.wav|But they make the mistake of ignoring their own duality.
DUMMY/arctic_a0304.wav|I graduated last of my class.
DUMMY/arctic_a0305.wav|They had no fixed values, to be altered by adjectives and adverbs.
DUMMY/arctic_a0306.wav|He was pressing beyond the limits of his vocabulary.
DUMMY/arctic_a0307.wav|Very early in my life, I separated from my mother.
DUMMY/arctic_a0308.wav|His infernal chattering worries me even now as I think of it.
DUMMY/arctic_a0309.wav|White Leghorns, said Mrs Mortimer.
DUMMY/arctic_a0310.wav|Massage under tension, was the cryptic reply.
DUMMY/arctic_a0311.wav|Therefore, hurrah for the game.
DUMMY/arctic_a0312.wav|It lived in perpetual apprehension of that quarter of the compass.
DUMMY/arctic_a0313.wav|Broken-Tooth yelled with fright and pain.
DUMMY/arctic_a0314.wav|Thus was momentum gained in the Younger World.
DUMMY/arctic_a0315.wav|Saxon waited, for she knew a fresh idea had struck Billy.
DUMMY/arctic_a0316.wav|We had been chased by them ourselves, more than once.
DUMMY/arctic_a0317.wav|He was a wise hyena.
DUMMY/arctic_a0318.wav|Production is doubling and quadrupling upon itself.
DUMMY/arctic_a0319.wav|And the Edinburgh Evening News says, with editorial gloom.
DUMMY/arctic_a0320.wav|With my strength I slammed it full into Red-Eye's face.
DUMMY/arctic_a0321.wav|The log on which Lop-Ear was lying got adrift.
DUMMY/arctic_a0322.wav|This is a common experience with all of us.
DUMMY/arctic_a0323.wav|He considered the victory already his and stepped forward to the meat.
DUMMY/arctic_a0324.wav|It was not Red-Eye's way to forego revenge so easily.
DUMMY/arctic_a0325.wav|Whiz-zip-bang. Lop-Ear screamed with sudden anguish.
DUMMY/arctic_a0326.wav|Cherokee identified himself with his instinct.
DUMMY/arctic_a0327.wav|They were less stooped than we, less springy in their movements.
DUMMY/arctic_a0328.wav|The Fire People, like ourselves, lived in caves.
DUMMY/arctic_a0329.wav|Ah, indeed.
DUMMY/arctic_a0330.wav|Red-Eye never committed a more outrageous deed.
DUMMY/arctic_a0331.wav|Poor little Crooked-Leg was terribly scared.
DUMMY/arctic_a0332.wav|Unconsciously, our yells and exclamations yielded to this rhythm.
DUMMY/arctic_a0333.wav|This is no place for you.
DUMMY/arctic_a0334.wav|He'll knock you off a few sticks in no time.
DUMMY/arctic_a0335.wav|Red-Eye swung back and forth on the branch farther down.
DUMMY/arctic_a0336.wav|So unexpected was my charge that I knocked him off his feet.
DUMMY/arctic_a0337.wav|Encouraged by my conduct, Big-Face became a sudden ally.
DUMMY/arctic_a0338.wav|The fighting had now become intermittent.
DUMMY/arctic_a0339.wav|They obeyed him, and went here and there at his commands.
DUMMY/arctic_a0340.wav|It was like the beating of hoofs.
DUMMY/arctic_a0341.wav|Why, doggone you all, shake again.
DUMMY/arctic_a0342.wav|Seventeen, no, eighteen days ago.
DUMMY/arctic_a0343.wav|You mean for this State, General, Alberta.
DUMMY/arctic_a0344.wav|He seemed to fill it with his tremendous vitality.
DUMMY/arctic_a0345.wav|She was trying to pass the apron string around him.
DUMMY/arctic_a0346.wav|Get down and dig in.
DUMMY/arctic_a0347.wav|They are greatly delighted with anything that is bright or giveth a sound.
DUMMY/arctic_a0348.wav|They only lifted seven hundred and fifty.
DUMMY/arctic_a0349.wav|It was simple, in its way, and no virtue of his.
DUMMY/arctic_a0350.wav|Is that Pat Hanrahan's mug looking hungry and willing.
DUMMY/arctic_a0351.wav|It was more like sugar.
DUMMY/arctic_a0352.wav|I'm sure going along with you all, Elijah.
DUMMY/arctic_a0353.wav|Here the explosion of mirth drowned him out.
DUMMY/arctic_a0354.wav|Fresh meat they failed to obtain.
DUMMY/arctic_a0355.wav|A burst of laughter was his reward.
DUMMY/arctic_a0356.wav|You don't catch me at any such foolishness.
DUMMY/arctic_a0357.wav|A month passed by, and Bonanza Creek remained quiet.
DUMMY/arctic_a0358.wav|They continued valiantly to lie, but the truth continued to outrun them.
DUMMY/arctic_a0359.wav|Earth and gravel seemed to fill the pan.
DUMMY/arctic_a0360.wav|But he no longer cared quite so much for that form of diversion.
DUMMY/arctic_a0361.wav|But he did not broach it, preferring to mature it carefully.
DUMMY/arctic_a0362.wav|Nope, not the slightest idea.
DUMMY/arctic_a0363.wav|It is not an attempt to smash the market.
DUMMY/arctic_a0364.wav|We have plenty of capital ourselves, and yet we want more.
DUMMY/arctic_a0365.wav|These rumors may even originate with us.
DUMMY/arctic_a0366.wav|A wildly exciting time was his during the week preceding Thursday the eighteenth.
DUMMY/arctic_a0367.wav|There is not an iota of truth in it, certainly not.
DUMMY/arctic_a0368.wav|I just do appreciate it without being able to express my feelings.
DUMMY/arctic_a0369.wav|In partnership with Daylight, the pair raided the San Jose Interurban.
DUMMY/arctic_a0370.wav|He saw all men in the business game doing this.
DUMMY/arctic_a0371.wav|It issued a rate of forty two dollars a car on charcoal.
DUMMY/arctic_a0372.wav|He saw only the effect in a general, sketchy way.
DUMMY/arctic_a0373.wav|Points of view, new ideas, life.
DUMMY/arctic_a0374.wav|But life's worth more than cash, she argued.
DUMMY/arctic_a0375.wav|The butchers and meat cutters refused to handle meat destined for unfair restaurants.
DUMMY/arctic_a0376.wav|Your price, my son, is just about thirty per week.
DUMMY/arctic_a0377.wav|This sound did not disturb the hush and awe of the place.
DUMMY/arctic_a0378.wav|That's why its boundaries are all gouged and jagged.
DUMMY/arctic_a0379.wav|How old are you, daddy.
DUMMY/arctic_a0380.wav|But in the canyons water was plentiful and also a luxuriant forest growth.
DUMMY/arctic_a0381.wav|My name's Ferguson.
DUMMY/arctic_a0382.wav|Daylight found himself charmed and made curious by the little man.
DUMMY/arctic_a0383.wav|To his surprise, her answer was flat and uncompromising.
DUMMY/arctic_a0384.wav|The farmer works the soil and produces grain.
DUMMY/arctic_a0385.wav|That's what Carnegie did.
DUMMY/arctic_a0386.wav|I can't argue with you, and you know that.
DUMMY/arctic_a0387.wav|Bob, growing disgusted, turned back suddenly and attempted to pass Mab.
DUMMY/arctic_a0388.wav|It was my idea to a tee.
DUMMY/arctic_a0389.wav|Mab, she said.
DUMMY/arctic_a0390.wav|I'll go over tomorrow afternoon.
DUMMY/arctic_a0391.wav|But he reconciled himself to it by an act of faith.
DUMMY/arctic_a0392.wav|There is that magnificent Bob, eating his head off in the stable.
DUMMY/arctic_a0393.wav|Already he had begun borrowing from the banks.
DUMMY/arctic_a0394.wav|It's the strap hangers that'll keep us from going under.
DUMMY/arctic_a0395.wav|As for himself, weren't the street railway earnings increasing steadily.
DUMMY/arctic_a0396.wav|A rising tide of fat had submerged them.
DUMMY/arctic_a0397.wav|Call me that again, he murmured ecstatically.
DUMMY/arctic_a0398.wav|In the car were Unwin and Harrison, while Jones sat with the chauffeur.
DUMMY/arctic_a0399.wav|And here's another idea.
DUMMY/arctic_a0400.wav|Manuel had one besetting sin.
DUMMY/arctic_a0401.wav|The man smiled grimly, and brought a hatchet and a club.
DUMMY/arctic_a0402.wav|Curly rushed her antagonist, who struck again and leaped aside.
DUMMY/arctic_a0403.wav|His newborn cunning gave him poise and control.
DUMMY/arctic_a0404.wav|Perrault found one with head buried in the grub box.
DUMMY/arctic_a0405.wav|It seemed the ordained order of things that dogs should work.
DUMMY/arctic_a0406.wav|And that was the last of Francois and Perrault.
DUMMY/arctic_a0407.wav|Mercedes screamed, cried, laughed, and manifested the chaotic abandonment of hysteria.
DUMMY/arctic_a0408.wav|The Eldorado emptied its occupants into the street to see the test.
DUMMY/arctic_a0409.wav|He could feel a new stir in the land.
DUMMY/arctic_a0410.wav|So we have to fit the boat throughout with oil lamps as well.
DUMMY/arctic_a0411.wav|It will break our hearts and our backs to hoist anchor by hand.
DUMMY/arctic_a0412.wav|There is another virtue in these bulkheads.
DUMMY/arctic_a0413.wav|But I am at the end of my resources.
DUMMY/arctic_a0414.wav|Now our figuring was all right.
DUMMY/arctic_a0415.wav|It lasted as a deterrent for two days.
DUMMY/arctic_a0416.wav|The added weight had a velocity of fifteen miles per hour.
DUMMY/arctic_a0417.wav|It is also an insidious, deceitful sun.
DUMMY/arctic_a0418.wav|The Portuguese boy crawled nearer and nearer.
DUMMY/arctic_a0419.wav|The Portuguese boy passed the Hawaiian.
DUMMY/arctic_a0420.wav|When I came to I was waving my hat and murmuring ecstatically.
DUMMY/arctic_a0421.wav|By golly, the boy wins.
DUMMY/arctic_a0422.wav|Halfway around the track one donkey got into an argument with its rider.
DUMMY/arctic_a0423.wav|McVeigh when he returns from a trip to Honolulu.
DUMMY/arctic_a0424.wav|Obviously, it was a disease that could be contracted by contact.
DUMMY/arctic_a0425.wav|Otherwise no restriction is put upon their seafaring.
DUMMY/arctic_a0426.wav|They do not know the length of time of incubation.
DUMMY/arctic_a0427.wav|Enters now the psychology of the situation.
DUMMY/arctic_a0428.wav|It was not exactly a deportation.
DUMMY/arctic_a0429.wav|Quick was the disappointment in his face, yet smiling was the acquiescence.
DUMMY/arctic_a0430.wav|Nevertheless we found ourselves once more in the high seat of abundance.
DUMMY/arctic_a0431.wav|Wada and Nakata were in a bit of a funk.
DUMMY/arctic_a0432.wav|The boy at the wheel lost his head.
DUMMY/arctic_a0433.wav|To her the bridge was tambo, which is the native for taboo.
DUMMY/arctic_a0434.wav|A half a case of tobacco was worth three pounds.
DUMMY/arctic_a0435.wav|What do you mean by this outrageous conduct.
DUMMY/arctic_a0436.wav|But Martin smiled a superior smile.
DUMMY/arctic_a0437.wav|By that answer my professional medical prestige stood or fell.
DUMMY/arctic_a0438.wav|At sea, Monday, March 16, 1908.
DUMMY/arctic_a0439.wav|At sea, Wednesday, March 18, 1908.
DUMMY/arctic_a0440.wav|Yes, sir, I corrected.
DUMMY/arctic_a0441.wav|Violent life and athletic sports had never appealed to me.
DUMMY/arctic_a0442.wav|You live on an income which your father earned.
DUMMY/arctic_a0443.wav|He was worth nothing to the world.
DUMMY/arctic_a0444.wav|Then you don't believe in altruism.
DUMMY/arctic_a0445.wav|The creative joy, I murmured.
DUMMY/arctic_a0446.wav|He deluged me, overwhelmed me with argument.
DUMMY/arctic_a0447.wav|Ah, it is growing dark and darker.
DUMMY/arctic_a0448.wav|I was Hump, cabin boy on the schooner Ghost.
DUMMY/arctic_a0449.wav|A sinewy hand, dripping with water, was clutching the rail.
DUMMY/arctic_a0450.wav|No man ate of the seal meat or the oil.
DUMMY/arctic_a0451.wav|I noticed blood spouting from Kerfoot's left hand.
DUMMY/arctic_a0452.wav|Three oilers and a fourth engineer, was his greeting.
DUMMY/arctic_a0453.wav|Eighteen hundred, he calculated.
DUMMY/arctic_a0454.wav|The sharp voice of Wolf Larsen aroused me.
DUMMY/arctic_a0455.wav|I obeyed, and a minute or two later they stood before him.
DUMMY/arctic_a0456.wav|But it won't continue, she said with easy confidence.
DUMMY/arctic_a0457.wav|What I saw I could not at first believe.
DUMMY/arctic_a0458.wav|The stout wood was crushed like an eggshell.
DUMMY/arctic_a0459.wav|There's too much of the schoolboy in me.
DUMMY/arctic_a0460.wav|I had forgotten their existence.
DUMMY/arctic_a0461.wav|Ah, we were very close together in that moment.
DUMMY/arctic_a0462.wav|But she swung obediently on her heel into the wind.
DUMMY/arctic_a0463.wav|They are his tongue, by which he makes his knowledge articulate.
DUMMY/arctic_a0464.wav|Between the rush of the cascades, streaks of rust showed everywhere.
DUMMY/arctic_a0465.wav|He'll never do a tap of work the whole Voyage.
DUMMY/arctic_a0466.wav|Captain West may be a Samurai, but he is also human.
DUMMY/arctic_a0467.wav|And so early in the voyage, too.
DUMMY/arctic_a0468.wav|In the matter of curry she is a sheer genius.
DUMMY/arctic_a0469.wav|The eastern heavens were equally spectacular.
DUMMY/arctic_a0470.wav|He spat it out like so much venom.
DUMMY/arctic_a0471.wav|I saw Mr Pike nod his head grimly and sarcastically.
DUMMY/arctic_a0472.wav|He is too keenly intelligent, too sharply sensitive, successfully to endure.
DUMMY/arctic_a0473.wav|The night was calm and snowy.
DUMMY/arctic_a0474.wav|I sailed third mate in the little Vampire before you were born.
DUMMY/arctic_a0475.wav|His outstretched arm dropped to his side, and he paused.
DUMMY/arctic_a0476.wav|At this moment I felt a stir at my shoulder.
DUMMY/arctic_a0477.wav|Wada, Louis, and the steward are servants of Asiatic breed.
DUMMY/arctic_a0478.wav|Also, she has forbidden them smoking their pipes in the after-room.
DUMMY/arctic_a0479.wav|I tried to read George Moore last night, and was dreadfully bored.
DUMMY/arctic_a0480.wav|Tom Spink has a harpoon.
DUMMY/arctic_a0481.wav|Nimrod replied, with a slight manifestation of sensitiveness.
DUMMY/arctic_a0482.wav|And their chief virtue lies in that they will never wear out.
DUMMY/arctic_a0483.wav|Beyond dispute, Corry Hutchinson had married Mabel Holmes.
DUMMY/arctic_a0484.wav|No-sir-ee.
DUMMY/arctic_a0485.wav|Each insult added to the value of the claim.
DUMMY/arctic_a0486.wav|For the rest, he was a mere automaton.
DUMMY/arctic_a0487.wav|The river bared its bosom, and snorting steamboats challenged the wilderness.
DUMMY/arctic_a0488.wav|Their love burned with increasing brightness.
DUMMY/arctic_a0489.wav|They were artists, not biologists.
DUMMY/arctic_a0490.wav|Both Johnny and his mother shuffled their feet as they walked.
DUMMY/arctic_a0491.wav|And as in denial of guilt, the one-legged boy replied.
DUMMY/arctic_a0492.wav|Burnt out like the crater of a volcano.
DUMMY/arctic_a0493.wav|The boy, O'Brien, was specially maltreated.
DUMMY/arctic_a0494.wav|O'Brien took off his coat and bared his right arm.
DUMMY/arctic_a0495.wav|He bore no grudges and had few enemies.
DUMMY/arctic_a0496.wav|And Tom King patiently endured.
DUMMY/arctic_a0497.wav|King took every advantage he knew.
DUMMY/arctic_a0498.wav|The lines were now very taut.
DUMMY/arctic_a0499.wav|And right there I saw and knew it all.
DUMMY/arctic_a0500.wav|Who the devil gave it to you to be judge and jury.
DUMMY/arctic_a0501.wav|You're joking me, sir, the other managed to articulate.
DUMMY/arctic_a0502.wav|Anything unusual or abnormal was sufficient to send a fellow to Molokai.
DUMMY/arctic_a0503.wav|His beady black eyes saw bargains where other men saw bankruptcy.
DUMMY/arctic_a0504.wav|He was an athlete and a giant.
DUMMY/arctic_a0505.wav|We fished sharks on Niihau together.
DUMMY/arctic_a0506.wav|The Claudine was leaving next morning for Honolulu.
DUMMY/arctic_a0507.wav|In short, my joyous individualism was dominated by the orthodox bourgeois ethics.
DUMMY/arctic_a0508.wav|Soon shall it be thrust back from off prostrate humanity.
DUMMY/arctic_a0509.wav|Yet, in accordance with Ernest's test of truth, it worked.
DUMMY/arctic_a0510.wav|Much more Ernest told them of themselves and of his disillusionment.
DUMMY/arctic_a0511.wav|There is more behind this than a mere university ideal.
DUMMY/arctic_a0512.wav|No, it is a palace, wherein there are many servants.
DUMMY/arctic_a0513.wav|We must give ourselves and not our money alone.
DUMMY/arctic_a0514.wav|We are consumed in our own flesh-pots.
DUMMY/arctic_a0515.wav|But here amongst ourselves let us speak out.
DUMMY/arctic_a0516.wav|Also, there was awe in their faces.
DUMMY/arctic_a0517.wav|Out of abstractions Ernest had conjured a vision and made them see it.
DUMMY/arctic_a0518.wav|Illuminating oil was becoming all profit.
DUMMY/arctic_a0519.wav|Such an act was in direct violation of the laws of the land.
DUMMY/arctic_a0520.wav|He was fond of quoting a fragment from a certain poem.
DUMMY/arctic_a0521.wav|Without them he could not run his empire.
DUMMY/arctic_a0522.wav|For such countries nothing remained but reorganization.
DUMMY/arctic_a0523.wav|They could not continue their method of producing surpluses.
DUMMY/arctic_a0524.wav|At once would be instituted a dozen cooperative commonwealth states.
DUMMY/arctic_a0525.wav|The Oligarchy wanted violence, and it set its agents provocateurs to work.
DUMMY/arctic_a0526.wav|Nowhere did the raw earth appear.
DUMMY/arctic_a0527.wav|The lush vegetation of that sheltered spot make a natural shield.
DUMMY/arctic_a0528.wav|Men who endure it, call it living death.
DUMMY/arctic_a0529.wav|As I say, he had tapped the message very rapidly.
DUMMY/arctic_a0530.wav|Ask him, I laughed, then turned to Pasquini.
DUMMY/arctic_a0531.wav|In what bucolic school of fence he had been taught was beyond imagining.
DUMMY/arctic_a0532.wav|May drought destroy your crops.
DUMMY/arctic_a0533.wav|Dunham, can your boy go along with Jesse.
DUMMY/arctic_a0534.wav|But Johannes could, and did.
DUMMY/arctic_a0535.wav|A new preacher and a new doctrine come to Jerusalem.
DUMMY/arctic_a0536.wav|He would destroy all things that are fixed.
DUMMY/arctic_a0537.wav|He was an enthusiast and a desert dweller.
DUMMY/arctic_a0538.wav|What Pascal glimpsed with the vision of a seer, I have lived.
DUMMY/arctic_a0539.wav|I should like to engage just for one whole life in that.
DUMMY/arctic_a0540.wav|Yea, so are all the lesser animals of today clean.
DUMMY/arctic_a0541.wav|The Warden with a quart of champagne.
DUMMY/arctic_a0542.wav|Without a doubt, some of them have dinner engagements.
DUMMY/arctic_a0543.wav|I had been born with no organic, chemical predisposition toward alcohol.
DUMMY/arctic_a0544.wav|He may anticipate the day of his death.
DUMMY/arctic_a0545.wav|The Italian rancho was a bachelor establishment.
DUMMY/arctic_a0546.wav|I lost my balance and pitched head foremost into the ooze.
DUMMY/arctic_a0547.wav|Men like Joe Goose dated existence from drunk to drunk.
DUMMY/arctic_a0548.wav|Also, churches and preachers I had never known.
DUMMY/arctic_a0549.wav|Do you know that we weigh every pound of coal we burn.
DUMMY/arctic_a0550.wav|This also became part of the daily schedule.
DUMMY/arctic_a0551.wav|All an appearance can know is mirage.
DUMMY/arctic_a0552.wav|Yet he dreams he is immortal, I argue feebly.
DUMMY/arctic_a0553.wav|I am writing these lines in Honolulu, Hawaii.
DUMMY/arctic_a0554.wav|Jack London, Waikiki Beach, Honolulu, Oahu.
DUMMY/arctic_a0555.wav|Jerry was so secure in his nook that he did not roll away.
DUMMY/arctic_a0556.wav|Why, he's bought forty pounds of goods from you already.
DUMMY/arctic_a0557.wav|The last refugee had passed.
DUMMY/arctic_a0558.wav|And the foundation stone of service, in his case, was obedience.
DUMMY/arctic_a0559.wav|Peace be unto you and grace before the Lord.
DUMMY/arctic_a0560.wav|His mouth opened; words shaped vainly on his lips.
DUMMY/arctic_a0561.wav|Bill lingered, contemplating his work with artistic appreciation.
DUMMY/arctic_a0562.wav|What the flaming.
DUMMY/arctic_a0563.wav|Mrs McFee's jaws brought together with a snap.
DUMMY/arctic_a0564.wav|Then it is as I said, Womble announced with finality.
DUMMY/arctic_a0565.wav|With them were Indians, also three other men.
DUMMY/arctic_a0566.wav|Dennin's hands were released long enough for him to sign the document.
DUMMY/arctic_a0567.wav|Now Irvine was a man of impulse, a poet.
DUMMY/arctic_a0568.wav|He was just bursting with joy, joy over what.
DUMMY/arctic_a0569.wav|At Lake Linderman I had one canoe, very good Peterborough canoe.
DUMMY/arctic_a0570.wav|Behind him lay the thousand-years-long road across all Siberia and Russia.
DUMMY/arctic_a0571.wav|He had forgotten to build a fire and thaw out.
DUMMY/arctic_a0572.wav|I never saw anything like her in my life.
DUMMY/arctic_a0573.wav|There was no law on the Yukon save what they made for themselves.
DUMMY/arctic_a0574.wav|Good business man, Curly, O'Brien was saying.
DUMMY/arctic_a0575.wav|There weren't any missions, and he was the man to know.
DUMMY/arctic_a0576.wav|And the big Persian knew of his existence before he did of hers.
DUMMY/arctic_a0577.wav|Once the jews harp began emitting its barbaric rhythms, Michael was helpless.
DUMMY/arctic_a0578.wav|But we'll just postpone this.
DUMMY/arctic_a0579.wav|There was the Emma Louisa.
DUMMY/arctic_a0580.wav|This is my fifth voyage.
DUMMY/arctic_a0581.wav|It was this proposition that started the big idea in Daughtry's mind.
DUMMY/arctic_a0582.wav|Daughtry elaborated on the counting trick by bringing Cocky along.
DUMMY/arctic_a0583.wav|Enjoy it he did, but principally for Steward's sake.
DUMMY/arctic_a0584.wav|I have long noted your thirst unquenchable.
DUMMY/arctic_a0585.wav|Wonder if he's a lion dog, Charles suggested.
DUMMY/arctic_a0586.wav|We don't see ourselves as foolish.
DUMMY/arctic_a0587.wav|He had comparatively no advantages at first.
DUMMY/arctic_a0588.wav|He had proved it today, with his amateurish and sophomoric productions.
DUMMY/arctic_a0589.wav|I was sick once -- typhoid.
DUMMY/arctic_a0590.wav|In a way he is my protege.
DUMMY/arctic_a0591.wav|We are both children together.
DUMMY/arctic_a0592.wav|It's only his indigestion I find fault with.
DUMMY/arctic_a0593.wav|She'd make a good wife for the cashier.
DUMMY/arctic_b0001.wav|Gad, do I remember it.
DUMMY/arctic_b0002.wav|You got out by fighting, and I through a pretty girl.
DUMMY/arctic_b0003.wav|I can see that knife now.
DUMMY/arctic_b0004.wav|When I can't see beauty in woman I want to die.
DUMMY/arctic_b0005.wav|His slim fingers closed like steel about Philip's.
DUMMY/arctic_b0006.wav|He seized Gregson by the arm and led him to the door.
DUMMY/arctic_b0007.wav|Hear the Indian dogs wailing down at Churchill.
DUMMY/arctic_b0008.wav|Burke himself had criticized it because of the smile.
DUMMY/arctic_b0009.wav|I'd say there was going to be a glorious scrap.
DUMMY/arctic_b0010.wav|He turned the map to Gregson, pointing with his finger.
DUMMY/arctic_b0011.wav|His eyes never took themselves for an instant from his companion's face.
DUMMY/arctic_b0012.wav|Something that Whittemore had not yet said thrilled him.
DUMMY/arctic_b0013.wav|Lakes and rivers, hundreds of them, thousands of them.
DUMMY/arctic_b0014.wav|Whitefish, Gregson, whitefish and trout.
DUMMY/arctic_b0015.wav|They robbed me a few years later.
DUMMY/arctic_b0016.wav|He chuckled as he pulled out his pipe and began filling it.
DUMMY/arctic_b0017.wav|Everything was working smoothly, better than I had expected.
DUMMY/arctic_b0018.wav|I was completely lost in my work.
DUMMY/arctic_b0019.wav|His slim hands gripped the edges of the table.
DUMMY/arctic_b0020.wav|He made no reply as he waited for Whittemore to continue.
DUMMY/arctic_b0021.wav|Philip dropped back into his chair.
DUMMY/arctic_b0022.wav|If I was out of the game it would be easily made.
DUMMY/arctic_b0023.wav|MacDougall, my engineer, believes it.
DUMMY/arctic_b0024.wav|It is growing, every day, every hour.
DUMMY/arctic_b0025.wav|Now, you understand.
DUMMY/arctic_b0026.wav|You have associated with some of these men.
DUMMY/arctic_b0027.wav|And there's no chivalry, no quarter shown in this fight.
DUMMY/arctic_b0028.wav|Lord Fitzhugh is the key to the whole situation.
DUMMY/arctic_b0029.wav|All operations have been carried on from Montreal and Toronto.
DUMMY/arctic_b0030.wav|Gregson held a lighted match until it burnt his fingertips.
DUMMY/arctic_b0031.wav|Gregson had seated himself under the lamp and was sharpening a pencil.
DUMMY/arctic_b0032.wav|He caught himself with a jerk.
DUMMY/arctic_b0033.wav|How does your wager look now.
DUMMY/arctic_b0034.wav|He confessed that the sketch had startled him.
DUMMY/arctic_b0035.wav|After all, the picture was only a resemblance.
DUMMY/arctic_b0036.wav|He wondered, too, where Roscoe was.
DUMMY/arctic_b0037.wav|Philip knew that she was not an Indian.
DUMMY/arctic_b0038.wav|In her haste to get away she had forgotten these things.
DUMMY/arctic_b0039.wav|Philip took a step toward Gregson, half determined to awaken him.
DUMMY/arctic_b0040.wav|The thought set his blood tingling.
DUMMY/arctic_b0041.wav|But if Pierre did not return, until tomorrow.
DUMMY/arctic_b0042.wav|Ten minutes had not elapsed since he had dropped the handkerchief.
DUMMY/arctic_b0043.wav|It won't be for sale.
DUMMY/arctic_b0044.wav|For a few moments he ate in silence.
DUMMY/arctic_b0045.wav|Philip did not pursue the subject.
DUMMY/arctic_b0046.wav|Philip produced a couple of cigars and took a chair opposite him.
DUMMY/arctic_b0047.wav|Suppose you saw me at work through the window.
DUMMY/arctic_b0048.wav|He looked like one who had passed through an uncomfortable hour or two.
DUMMY/arctic_b0049.wav|There was nothing more, except a large ink blot under the words.
DUMMY/arctic_b0050.wav|All this day Gregson remained in the cabin.
DUMMY/arctic_b0051.wav|The sixth day he spent in the cabin with Gregson.
DUMMY/arctic_b0052.wav|The flush was gone from her face.
DUMMY/arctic_b0053.wav|That is why I am, am rattled, he laughed.
DUMMY/arctic_b0054.wav|He understood the meaning of the look.
DUMMY/arctic_b0055.wav|She was even more beautiful than when I saw her, before.
DUMMY/arctic_b0056.wav|I'll give a thousand if you produce her, retorted Gregson.
DUMMY/arctic_b0057.wav|They have won popular sentiment through the newspapers.
DUMMY/arctic_b0058.wav|We must achieve our own salvation.
DUMMY/arctic_b0059.wav|In moments of mental energy Philip was restless.
DUMMY/arctic_b0060.wav|He would keep his faith with Gregson for the promised day or two.
DUMMY/arctic_b0061.wav|Something about it seemed to fascinate him, to challenge his presence.
DUMMY/arctic_b0062.wav|Now it was missing from the wall.
DUMMY/arctic_b0063.wav|He boiled himself some coffee and sat down to wait.
DUMMY/arctic_b0064.wav|I'm going down there with you, and I'm going to fight.
DUMMY/arctic_b0065.wav|Now have you got anything to say against me, Mr Philip.
DUMMY/arctic_b0066.wav|If I meet her again I shall apologize, said Eileen.
DUMMY/arctic_b0067.wav|Below him the shadow was broken into a pool of rippling starlight.
DUMMY/arctic_b0068.wav|Only the chance sound had led him to observe them.
DUMMY/arctic_b0069.wav|Could the incident have anything to do with Jeanne and Pierre.
DUMMY/arctic_b0070.wav|There was no chance to fire without hitting him.
DUMMY/arctic_b0071.wav|There was no answer from the other side.
DUMMY/arctic_b0072.wav|Then he hastened on, as Pierre had guided him.
DUMMY/arctic_b0073.wav|With these arguments he convinced himself that he should go on alone.
DUMMY/arctic_b0074.wav|Yet, behind them there was another and more powerful motive.
DUMMY/arctic_b0075.wav|In that case he could not miss them, if he used caution.
DUMMY/arctic_b0076.wav|Before Philip could recover himself Jeanne's startled guards were upon him.
DUMMY/arctic_b0077.wav|It is the nearest refuge.
DUMMY/arctic_b0078.wav|There was pride and strength, the ring of triumph in his voice.
DUMMY/arctic_b0079.wav|The truth of it set Jeanne quivering.
DUMMY/arctic_b0080.wav|Tomorrow it will be strong enough for you to stand upon.
DUMMY/arctic_b0081.wav|You were going to leave after you saw me on the rock.
DUMMY/arctic_b0082.wav|He bit his tongue, and cursed himself at this fresh break.
DUMMY/arctic_b0083.wav|In it there was something that was almost tragedy.
DUMMY/arctic_b0084.wav|Your face is red with blood.
DUMMY/arctic_b0085.wav|Her eyes smiled truth at him as he came up the bank.
DUMMY/arctic_b0086.wav|He can care for himself.
DUMMY/arctic_b0087.wav|They will search for us between their camp and Churchill.
DUMMY/arctic_b0088.wav|Until I die, he exclaimed.
DUMMY/arctic_b0089.wav|Her beautiful hair was done up in shining coils.
DUMMY/arctic_b0090.wav|The Churchill narrowed and its current became swifter as they progressed.
DUMMY/arctic_b0091.wav|For a full half minute Jeanne looked at him without speaking.
DUMMY/arctic_b0092.wav|I want to die in it.
DUMMY/arctic_b0093.wav|Darkness hid him from Jeanne.
DUMMY/arctic_b0094.wav|And yet if she came he had no words to say.
DUMMY/arctic_b0095.wav|He heard a sound which brought him quickly into consciousness of day.
DUMMY/arctic_b0096.wav|Within himself he called it no longer his own.
DUMMY/arctic_b0097.wav|Besides, that noise makes me deaf.
DUMMY/arctic_b0098.wav|Philip looked back from the crest and saw Jeanne leaning over the canoe.
DUMMY/arctic_b0099.wav|Fifty yards ahead of her were the first of the rocks.
DUMMY/arctic_b0100.wav|There was one chance, and only one, of saving Jeanne.
DUMMY/arctic_b0101.wav|You're a devil for fighting, and will surely win.
DUMMY/arctic_b0102.wav|I'll only be in the way.
DUMMY/arctic_b0103.wav|He lifted his eyes, and a strange cry burst from his lips.
DUMMY/arctic_b0104.wav|Shooting pains passed like flashes of electricity through his body.
DUMMY/arctic_b0105.wav|I know that you are in charge there, and Jeanne knows.
DUMMY/arctic_b0106.wav|For a full minute the two men stared into each other's face.
DUMMY/arctic_b0107.wav|He was sure, now, of but few things.
DUMMY/arctic_b0108.wav|It was a miracle, and I owe you my life.
DUMMY/arctic_b0109.wav|Philip ate lightly of the food which Pierre had ready for him.
DUMMY/arctic_b0110.wav|Such men believe, when they come together.
DUMMY/arctic_b0111.wav|The journey was continued at dawn.
DUMMY/arctic_b0112.wav|Jeanne and Pierre both gazed toward the great rock.
DUMMY/arctic_b0113.wav|There was something pathetic in the girl's attitude now.
DUMMY/arctic_b0114.wav|He moved his position, and the illusion was gone.
DUMMY/arctic_b0115.wav|For two hours not a word passed between them.
DUMMY/arctic_b0116.wav|I have hunted along this ridge, replied Philip.
DUMMY/arctic_b0117.wav|That's Thorpe's, said the young engineer.
DUMMY/arctic_b0118.wav|We saw your light, and thought you wouldn't mind a call.
DUMMY/arctic_b0119.wav|Billinger may arrive in time.
DUMMY/arctic_b0120.wav|There's the hitch, replied Thorpe, rolling a cigarette.
DUMMY/arctic_b0121.wav|I want my men to work by themselves.
DUMMY/arctic_b0122.wav|Philip saw MacDougall soon after his short talk with Thorpe.
DUMMY/arctic_b0123.wav|Neither could they understand the growing disaffection among Thorpe's men.
DUMMY/arctic_b0124.wav|Two weeks passed, and in that time Thorpe left camp three times.
DUMMY/arctic_b0125.wav|It was the third or fourth time that Philip had heard MacDougall swear.
DUMMY/arctic_b0126.wav|Blood was oozing slowly from the wounded man's right breast.
DUMMY/arctic_b0127.wav|He destroyed everything that had belonged to the woman.
DUMMY/arctic_b0128.wav|Philip bent low over Pierre.
DUMMY/arctic_b0129.wav|Did Thorpe go to see any one in Churchill.
DUMMY/arctic_b0130.wav|She saw the answer in his face.
DUMMY/arctic_b0131.wav|Thorpe and his men were to destroy this camp, and kill you.
DUMMY/arctic_b0132.wav|There is no need of further detail, now -- for you can understand.
DUMMY/arctic_b0133.wav|There followed a roar that shook the earth.
DUMMY/arctic_b0134.wav|Blind with rage, he darted in.
DUMMY/arctic_b0135.wav|In it was the joy of life.
DUMMY/arctic_b0136.wav|Swiftly his eyes measured the situation.
DUMMY/arctic_b0137.wav|But this little defect did not worry him.
DUMMY/arctic_b0138.wav|And then, steadily, he began to chew.
DUMMY/arctic_b0139.wav|Together they ate the rabbit.
DUMMY/arctic_b0140.wav|They edged nearer, and stood shoulder to shoulder facing their world.
DUMMY/arctic_b0141.wav|It was beating and waiting in the ambush of those black pits.
DUMMY/arctic_b0142.wav|Something vastly more thrilling had come into it now.
DUMMY/arctic_b0143.wav|It took him half an hour to reach the edge of it.
DUMMY/arctic_b0144.wav|But there was no longer the mother yearning in his heart.
DUMMY/arctic_b0145.wav|Besides, had he not whipped the big owl in the forest.
DUMMY/arctic_b0146.wav|After all, it was simply a mistake in judgment.
DUMMY/arctic_b0147.wav|Had it struck squarely it would have killed him.
DUMMY/arctic_b0148.wav|The Indian even poked his stick into the thick ground spruce.
DUMMY/arctic_b0149.wav|Pebbles and dirt flew along with hair and fur.
DUMMY/arctic_b0150.wav|And he was filled with a strange and foreboding fear.
DUMMY/arctic_b0151.wav|It was steel, a fisher trap.
DUMMY/arctic_b0152.wav|OW, a wild dog, he growled.
DUMMY/arctic_b0153.wav|He was a pariah; a wanderer without a friend or a home.
DUMMY/arctic_b0154.wav|That is the strange part of it.
DUMMY/arctic_b0155.wav|His freshly caught furs he flung to the floor.
DUMMY/arctic_b0156.wav|For that reason Le Beau had chosen him to fight the big fight.
DUMMY/arctic_b0157.wav|In the crib the baby sat up and began to prattle.
DUMMY/arctic_b0158.wav|She obeyed, shrinking back with the baby in her arms.
DUMMY/arctic_b0159.wav|His teeth shut with a last click.
DUMMY/arctic_b0160.wav|It was over when he made his way through the ring of spectators.
DUMMY/arctic_b0161.wav|In a flash he was on his feet, facing him.
DUMMY/arctic_b0162.wav|He thought he saw a shudder pass through the Factor's shoulders.
DUMMY/arctic_b0163.wav|The moon had already begun its westward decline.
DUMMY/arctic_b0164.wav|They laughed like two happy children.
DUMMY/arctic_b0165.wav|He pulled, and the log crashed down to break his back.
DUMMY/arctic_b0166.wav|Fast, but endure.
DUMMY/arctic_b0167.wav|A little before dawn of the day following, the fire relief came.
DUMMY/arctic_b0168.wav|The Indian felt the worship of her warm in his heart.
DUMMY/arctic_b0169.wav|He drew in a deep breath as he looked at them.
DUMMY/arctic_b0170.wav|Then he shouted, Shut up.
DUMMY/arctic_b0171.wav|He changed his seat for a steamer reclining chair.
DUMMY/arctic_b0172.wav|On the far corner of the compound fence a hawk brooded.
DUMMY/arctic_b0173.wav|To these he gave castor oil.
DUMMY/arctic_b0174.wav|Hatred and murder and lust for revenge they possessed to overflowing.
DUMMY/arctic_b0175.wav|Sheldon glanced at the thermometer.
DUMMY/arctic_b0176.wav|I'll see to poor Hughie.
DUMMY/arctic_b0177.wav|Her gray eyes were flashing, and her lips were quivering.
DUMMY/arctic_b0178.wav|Also, I want information.
DUMMY/arctic_b0179.wav|Let them go out and eat with my boys.
DUMMY/arctic_b0180.wav|I, I beg pardon, he drawled.
DUMMY/arctic_b0181.wav|And you preferred a cannibal isle and a cartridge belt.
DUMMY/arctic_b0182.wav|I was in New York when the crash came.
DUMMY/arctic_b0183.wav|No, I did not fall among thieves.
DUMMY/arctic_b0184.wav|Such things in her brain were like so many oaths on her lips.
DUMMY/arctic_b0185.wav|Your being wrecked here has been a godsend to me.
DUMMY/arctic_b0186.wav|I can't go elsewhere, by your own account.
DUMMY/arctic_b0187.wav|Her achievements with cocoanuts were a revelation.
DUMMY/arctic_b0188.wav|He glanced down at her helplessly, and moistened his lips.
DUMMY/arctic_b0189.wav|That is what distinguishes all of us from the lower animals.
DUMMY/arctic_b0190.wav|Idealism led him to philosophic anarchy, and his family threw him off.
DUMMY/arctic_b0191.wav|He also contended that better confidence was established by carrying no weapons.
DUMMY/arctic_b0192.wav|Outsiders are allowed five minute speeches, the sick man urged.
DUMMY/arctic_b0193.wav|So was Packard's finish suicide.
DUMMY/arctic_b0194.wav|Joan cried, with shining eyes.
DUMMY/arctic_b0195.wav|Nobody knows how the natives got them.
DUMMY/arctic_b0196.wav|How can you manage all alone, Mr Young.
DUMMY/arctic_b0197.wav|The planters are already considering the matter.
DUMMY/arctic_b0198.wav|I use great trouble advisedly.
DUMMY/arctic_b0199.wav|Dear Sir, Your second victim has fallen on schedule time.
DUMMY/arctic_b0200.wav|We leave the eventuality to time and law.
DUMMY/arctic_b0201.wav|I also understand that similar branch organizations have made their appearance in Europe.
DUMMY/arctic_b0202.wav|Society is shaken to its foundations.
DUMMY/arctic_b0203.wav|A month in Australia would finish me.
DUMMY/arctic_b0204.wav|Down through the perfume weighted air fluttered the snowy fluffs of the cottonwoods.
DUMMY/arctic_b0205.wav|You were destroying my life.
DUMMY/arctic_b0206.wav|Horses and rifles had been her toys, camp and trail her nursery.
DUMMY/arctic_b0207.wav|I'm as good as a man, she urged.
DUMMY/arctic_b0208.wav|You read the quotations in today's paper.
DUMMY/arctic_b0209.wav|He's terribly touchy about his black wards, as he calls them.
DUMMY/arctic_b0210.wav|Whatever he guessed he locked away in the taboo room of Naomi.
DUMMY/arctic_b0211.wav|This is eighteen eighty.
DUMMY/arctic_b0212.wav|Death is and has been ever since old Maui died.
DUMMY/arctic_b0213.wav|Some boy, she laughed acquiescence.
DUMMY/arctic_b0214.wav|Let us talk it over and find a way out.
DUMMY/arctic_b0215.wav|It is a good property, and worth more than that.
DUMMY/arctic_b0216.wav|I wish you were more adaptable, Joan retorted.
DUMMY/arctic_b0217.wav|Such is my passage engaged on the steamer.
DUMMY/arctic_b0218.wav|The issue was not in doubt.
DUMMY/arctic_b0219.wav|Well, there are better men in Hawaii, that's all.
DUMMY/arctic_b0220.wav|Harry Bancroft, Dave lied.
DUMMY/arctic_b0221.wav|It's a Yankee, Joan cried.
DUMMY/arctic_b0222.wav|He was the leader, and Tudor was his lieutenant.
DUMMY/arctic_b0223.wav|They likewise are disinclined to being eaten.
DUMMY/arctic_b0224.wav|But to culture the Revolution thus far had exhausted the Junta.
DUMMY/arctic_b0225.wav|The President of the United States was his friend.
DUMMY/arctic_b0226.wav|Your face was the personification of duplicity.
DUMMY/arctic_b0227.wav|Shorty turned to their employers.
DUMMY/arctic_b0228.wav|You were engaged.
DUMMY/arctic_b0229.wav|I saw it all myself, and it was splendid.
DUMMY/arctic_b0230.wav|Now run along, and tell them to hurry.
DUMMY/arctic_b0231.wav|What's that grub-thief got to do with it.
DUMMY/arctic_b0232.wav|It was a superb picture.
DUMMY/arctic_b0233.wav|So she said, the irate skipper dashed on.
DUMMY/arctic_b0234.wav|And watch out for wet feet, was his parting advice.
DUMMY/arctic_b0235.wav|Raoul yelled, in order to make himself heard.
DUMMY/arctic_b0236.wav|Oolong was two hundred and fifty miles from the nearest land.
DUMMY/arctic_b0237.wav|They just lay off in the bush and plugged away.
DUMMY/arctic_b0238.wav|The very thought of the effort to swim over was nauseating.
DUMMY/arctic_b0239.wav|And there was a dog that barked.
DUMMY/arctic_b0240.wav|There are four, all low, McCoy answered.
DUMMY/arctic_b0241.wav|The women they carried away with them to the Big Valley.
DUMMY/arctic_b0242.wav|The Japanese understood as we could never school ourselves or hope to understand.
DUMMY/arctic_b0243.wav|They had been on the same lay as ourselves.
DUMMY/arctic_b0244.wav|You are positively soulless, he said savagely.
DUMMY/arctic_b0245.wav|Harrison is still my chauffeur.
DUMMY/arctic_b0246.wav|The boy grew and prospered.
DUMMY/arctic_b0247.wav|He wanted to give the finish to this foe already so far gone.
DUMMY/arctic_b0248.wav|Exciting times are the lot of the fish patrol.
DUMMY/arctic_b0249.wav|I know they are my oysters.
DUMMY/arctic_b0250.wav|By this time Charley was as enraged as the Greek.
DUMMY/arctic_b0251.wav|They must have been swept away by the chaotic currents.
DUMMY/arctic_b0252.wav|It resembled tea less than lager beer resembles champagne.
DUMMY/arctic_b0253.wav|The very opposite is true; they are discouraged vagabonds.
DUMMY/arctic_b0254.wav|At the same time spears and arrows began to fall among the invaders.
DUMMY/arctic_b0255.wav|Then, again, Tudor had such an irritating way about him.
DUMMY/arctic_b0256.wav|Outwardly, he maintained a calm and smiling aspect.
DUMMY/arctic_b0257.wav|Tudor surveyed him with withering disgust.
DUMMY/arctic_b0258.wav|You fired me out of your house, in short.
DUMMY/arctic_b0259.wav|Her mouth opened, but instead of speaking she drew a long sigh.
DUMMY/arctic_b0260.wav|It's worth eight dollars.
DUMMY/arctic_b0261.wav|And he did hurt my arm.
DUMMY/arctic_b0262.wav|Saxon's onto her job.
DUMMY/arctic_b0263.wav|Only once did I confide the strangeness of it all to another.
DUMMY/arctic_b0264.wav|But this time it was Saxon who rebelled.
DUMMY/arctic_b0265.wav|I was not to cry out in the face of fear.
DUMMY/arctic_b0266.wav|And now put yourself in my place for a moment.
DUMMY/arctic_b0267.wav|The boy threw back his head with pride.
DUMMY/arctic_b0268.wav|Saxon nodded, and the boy frowned.
DUMMY/arctic_b0269.wav|Why not like any railroad station or ferry depot.
DUMMY/arctic_b0270.wav|We could throw stones with our feet.
DUMMY/arctic_b0271.wav|It was put together in a casual, helter-skelter sort of way.
DUMMY/arctic_b0272.wav|These were merely stout sticks an inch or so in diameter.
DUMMY/arctic_b0273.wav|Then it was that a strange thing happened.
DUMMY/arctic_b0274.wav|From the source of light a harsh voice said.
DUMMY/arctic_b0275.wav|But I did not enjoy it long.
DUMMY/arctic_b0276.wav|We were now good friends.
DUMMY/arctic_b0277.wav|Two of the Folk were already up.
DUMMY/arctic_b0278.wav|Now animals do not like mockery.
DUMMY/arctic_b0279.wav|He gave one last snarl and slid from view among the trees.
DUMMY/arctic_b0280.wav|Again the girls applauded, and Mrs Hall cried.
DUMMY/arctic_b0281.wav|Just the same I'd sooner be myself than have book indigestion.
DUMMY/arctic_b0282.wav|Some of the smaller veins had doubtless been ruptured.
DUMMY/arctic_b0283.wav|But we were without this momentum.
DUMMY/arctic_b0284.wav|There was one difficulty, however.
DUMMY/arctic_b0285.wav|The hyena proceeded to dine.
DUMMY/arctic_b0286.wav|The time was considered auspicious.
DUMMY/arctic_b0287.wav|Or have they already devised one.
DUMMY/arctic_b0288.wav|We would not spend another such night.
DUMMY/arctic_b0289.wav|At first his progress was slow and erratic.
DUMMY/arctic_b0290.wav|He placed his paw on one, and its movements were accelerated.
DUMMY/arctic_b0291.wav|The awe of man rushed over him again.
DUMMY/arctic_b0292.wav|The Fire-Men wore animal skins around their waists and across their shoulders.
DUMMY/arctic_b0293.wav|Between him and all domestic animals there must be no hostilities.
DUMMY/arctic_b0294.wav|For a much longer time Lop-Ear and I remained and watched.
DUMMY/arctic_b0295.wav|All right, Sir, replied Jock with great regret.
DUMMY/arctic_b0296.wav|At times I wondered where Sir Archibald got his style.
DUMMY/arctic_b0297.wav|Why should a fellow throw up the sponge after the first round.
DUMMY/arctic_b0298.wav|His hand shot out and clutched Crooked-Leg by the neck.
DUMMY/arctic_b0299.wav|Miss Brodie's smile was slightly sarcastic.
DUMMY/arctic_b0300.wav|Does the old boy often go off at half-cock that way.
DUMMY/arctic_b0301.wav|A flying arrow passed between us.
DUMMY/arctic_b0302.wav|I pulled, suddenly, with all my might.
DUMMY/arctic_b0303.wav|Here we allow our solicitors to look after our legal work.
DUMMY/arctic_b0304.wav|His previous wives had never lived long enough to bear him children.
DUMMY/arctic_b0305.wav|It was our river emerging like ourselves from the great swamp.
DUMMY/arctic_b0306.wav|Cameron looked at his hands with their long, sinewy fingers.
DUMMY/arctic_b0307.wav|We got few vegetables and fruits, and became fish eaters.
DUMMY/arctic_b0308.wav|We never made another migration.
DUMMY/arctic_b0309.wav|Nor was Elam Harnish an exception.
DUMMY/arctic_b0310.wav|A little treatment, massage, with some help from the doctor.
DUMMY/arctic_b0311.wav|The 29th very foggy.
DUMMY/arctic_b0312.wav|Dig in; you're sure good, was Daylight's answer.
DUMMY/arctic_b0313.wav|The apron string loomed near and he shied like an unbroken colt.
DUMMY/arctic_b0314.wav|He had been born with this endowment.
DUMMY/arctic_b0315.wav|And this was their sole conversation throughout the meal.
DUMMY/arctic_b0316.wav|Though the aurora still flamed, another day had begun.
DUMMY/arctic_b0317.wav|He did not believe in the burning of daylight for such a luxury.
DUMMY/arctic_b0318.wav|Again he had done the big thing.
DUMMY/arctic_b0319.wav|Daylight was tired, profoundly tired.
DUMMY/arctic_b0320.wav|The regret in his voice was provocative of a second burst of laughter.
DUMMY/arctic_b0321.wav|Instead, he arrived on the night of the second day.
DUMMY/arctic_b0322.wav|Their supply of grub was gone.
DUMMY/arctic_b0323.wav|Crickets began to chirp, and more geese and ducks flew overhead.
DUMMY/arctic_b0324.wav|Not till the twentieth of May did the river break.
DUMMY/arctic_b0325.wav|It was a gigantic inadequacy.
DUMMY/arctic_b0326.wav|Our Mr Howison will call upon you at your hotel.
DUMMY/arctic_b0327.wav|He had been so easy.
DUMMY/arctic_b0328.wav|Change chairs, Daylight commanded.
DUMMY/arctic_b0329.wav|I'd sooner have my chips back.
DUMMY/arctic_b0330.wav|They only had a little thirty thousand dollar fire.
DUMMY/arctic_b0331.wav|His partners had starved and died on the Stewart.
DUMMY/arctic_b0332.wav|As to how she dressed, he had no ideas at all.
DUMMY/arctic_b0333.wav|It does, was her audacious answer.
DUMMY/arctic_b0334.wav|Oh, it's just a novel, a love story.
DUMMY/arctic_b0335.wav|Whoever lived on the ranch did that.
DUMMY/arctic_b0336.wav|How old are you, mother.
DUMMY/arctic_b0337.wav|Here he got a fresh thrill.
DUMMY/arctic_b0338.wav|It was unobtrusive, yet it was there.
DUMMY/arctic_b0339.wav|Well, I'll be plumb gosh darned.
DUMMY/arctic_b0340.wav|These quick little joys of hers were sources of joy to him.
DUMMY/arctic_b0341.wav|I play that choice wide open to win.
DUMMY/arctic_b0342.wav|Each improvement makes the value of everything else pump up.
DUMMY/arctic_b0343.wav|But how are you going to do it.
DUMMY/arctic_b0344.wav|Lots of men take women buggy riding.
DUMMY/arctic_b0345.wav|Daylight made no answer, and the door closed behind him.
DUMMY/arctic_b0346.wav|There's not an iota of truth in it.
DUMMY/arctic_b0347.wav|But ever his gaze returned to that Crouched Venus on the piano.
DUMMY/arctic_b0348.wav|Would you be satisfied with that one hundredth part of me.
DUMMY/arctic_b0349.wav|In such a tumbling of values was no time to sell.
DUMMY/arctic_b0350.wav|Stand off butcher and baker and all the rest.
